Folder Structure:?

We need to give users the ability to add movies to their favorites list:
This will result in a change/refactoring of our DB structure - possible ways to go about it:

Adding a column to the 'users' collection that stores a list of favorites? 

Adding a favorites collection with the user and movie PK 
(user_id, movie_id)
(   1   ,   200   ) 
This approach may work more efficiently - We can follow a similar approach to that of 
online shopping and a shopping cart.
